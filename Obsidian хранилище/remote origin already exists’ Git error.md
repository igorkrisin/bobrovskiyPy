## What is the ‘fatal: remote origin already exists’ error?

`fatal: remote origin already exists` is a common Git error that occurs when you clone a repository from GitHub, or an external remote repository, into your local machine and then try to update the pointing `origin` URL to your own repository.

In the context of Kubernetes, the error can occur when you configure orchestrations to include Git repositories. For example, by using: `git remote add origin [url].gits`

`fatal: remote origin already exists` is caused by the cloned repository already having a URL configured. Specifically, a URL that leads to the original profile where the repository source is.

## What is a remote origin in Git?

`remote origin`, as the name implies, is the place where code is stored remotely. It is the centralized server or zone where everyone pushes code to and pulls code from.

Remote repositories are versions of your project hosted on Git-compatible platforms such as GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, and Assembla. `origin` is the standard and generic handle that is used to associate the host site’s URL.

For example, you can have an alternative `remote` URL called `dev`, which then becomes the handle for a separate repository but for the same code.

When you run `git remote -v`, you will get a list of handles and associated URLs. So if you have different handlers for the same remote, the console output could look something like this:

D:GitHubgit remote -v
origin  https://github.com/prod_repo/projectx.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/prod_repo/projectx.git (push)
dev     https://github.com/dev_repo/projectx.git (fetch)
dev     https://github.com/dev_repo/projectx.git (push)  

This means that you can run the following command: `git push dev master`

The changes made will get pushed up to the `master` branch at the URL associated with `dev` and not `origin`.

## Resolving ‘fatal: remote origin already exists’

For most development environments, `origin` is the default handler used. Here are 3 ways to resolve `fatal: remote origin already exists`.

### 1. Remove the Existing Remote

`remote` refers to the hosted repository. origin is the pointer to where that remote is. Most of the time, `origin` is the only pointer there is on a local repository.

If you want to change the pointing URL attached to `origin`, you can remove the existing `origin` and then add it back in again with the correct URL.  
To remove your handler, use the `remove` command on `remote`, followed by the handler name – which, in our case, is `origin`.  
Here is an example: `git remote remove origin`

To check that handler is deleted properly, run the following: `git remote -v`

You will either get an empty list, or you will get a list of remote handlers that are currently attached to the project with origin removed from the list.  
Now you can run  without encountering the `fatal: remote origin already exists` error.

### 2. Update the Existing Remote’s URL

You are not always required to remove the origin handler from `remote`. An alternative way to solve fatal: remote origin already exists is to update the handler’s pointing URL.

To do this, you can use the `set-url` command, followed by the handler name (which is origin in our case) and the new URL.

Here is the syntax for updating an existing origin URL: git branch

Once this is completed, you can now push and pull code from the newly configured Git repository location.

### 3. Rename the Existing Remote

Alternatively, you can rename `origin` to something else. This means that instead of deleting the handler’s pointing URL to make room for the new one, you can rename it and keep the original details.

To do this, use the `rename` command on: `remote`.

For example, if you want to rename `origin` to `dev`, you can use the following command: `git remote rename origin dev`

Now when you run `git remote -v`, you will get dev as the handler instead of `origin`.

D:GitHub[some-repo]git remote -v
dev     https://github.com/some_repo/projectx.git (fetch)
dev     https://github.com/some_repo/projectx.git (push)  

This will give you room to add a new `origin` to the list of attached handlers. So when you run `git remote add origin [url].git`, you will no longer get the `fatal: remote origin already exists` error prompt.

## How to prevent ‘fatal: remote origin already exists’

To prevent `fatal: remote origin already exists` error from occurring, you can check if the `origin` handler already exists. If it does not, running the `git add remote origin` command should not produce this issue.

The most important thing to note here is that `origin` is only a handler’s short name. It is a reference to the URL, which is where the actual remote repository is hosted.

The handler `origin` just happens to be the standardized default. This is what makes `fatal: remote origin already exists` so common. The error itself can occur against any handler, provided that it has the same placeholder name.

To check if `origin` even exists, run `git remote -v` to get a list of current remote handlers and the associated URLs.

If origin exists, you can do one of the following:

- remove `origin` from the `remote` list via `remove` command, like so: `git remote remove origin`
- update origin pointing URL with `set-url`, like so:`git remote set-url origin [new-url]`
- rename the existing `origin` handler to something else via `rename` command: `git remote rename origin [new-name]`
